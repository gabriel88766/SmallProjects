# SmallProjects
Here are all my small projects, whether they are reusable functions in other projects or small projects for academic purposes.\
I usually can use C or Assembly but others languages can be found here

About the projects

### fibonacciMASMAssembly:
In this program was writed a function named fibonacci in assembly and put inside a code in C language. It compiles using command gcc -m32 -masm=intel fibonacciMASMAssembly.c or something like this with -m32 and -masm=intel\
The sequence there starts F<sub>0</sub> = 1 , F<sub>1</sub> = 1 , F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub> and the standard n value is 10 (and thus F<sub>10</sub> = 89 = output).
### noiseImageGenerator:
This program was made for generate random pixels and write into a bmp file. This program has 2 modes to write pixels and can be compiled in any C compiler with standard libraries.
