# SmallProjects
Here are all my small projects, whether they are reusable functions in other projects or small projects for academic purposes.\
I usually can use C or Assembly but others languages can be found here

About the projects

### bigIntegerInC-Slow
Here is my implementation of big integer. Is slower than the python implementation but it can do well in some problems. It can multiply number in O(nÂ²)
### InlineAssembly/fibonacciMASMAssembly:
In this program was writed a function named fibonacci in assembly and put inside a code in C language. It compiles using command gcc -m32 -masm=intel fibonacciMASMAssembly.c or something like this with -m32 and -masm=intel\
This program was made when I was trying to learn to code with inline Assembly in C.
### noiseImageGenerator:
This program was made for generate random pixels and write into a bmp file. This program has 2 modes to write pixels and can be compiled in any C compiler with standard libraries.
### spojNASM:
All my submitted problems in spoj using NASM using Linux system calls. There will be codes about any problems there
### SPOJ-C:
Here are all my submitted problems in spoj using C. There will be codes about any problems there
