# SmallProjects
Here are all my small projects, whether they are reusable functions in other projects or small projects for academic purposes.\
I usually can use C, C++ or Assembly but others languages can be found here too

About the projects

### bigIntegerInC-Slow
Here is my implementation of big integer. Is slower than the python and Java implementation but it can do well in some problems. It can multiply big numbers in O(nÂ²)
### InlineAssembly/fibonacciMASMAssembly:
In this program was writed a function named fibonacci in assembly and put inside a code in C language. It compiles using command gcc -m32 -masm=intel fibonacciMASMAssembly.c or something like this with -m32 and -masm=intel\
This program was made when I was trying to learn to code with inline Assembly in C. 
### noiseImageGenerator:
This program was made for generate random pixels and write into a bmp file. This program has 2 modes to write pixels and can be compiled in any C compiler with standard libraries.
### NASM:
Some of my codes using NASM to implement some basic functions
