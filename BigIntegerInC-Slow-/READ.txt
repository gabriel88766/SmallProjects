# BigInteger in C(Slow)
This is my implementation of big integer in C
You can print your number and make a new number with a string source using printBigint or newBigint
you can multiply by small numbers(smaller than 10^9) using multiplySmall
And of course, you can modify it to make it better

## Benchmark AMD Ryzen 5 3500U (this program can use only 1 core)
2^50000 1.8s
2^100000 4.2s
3^50000 2.5s
7^50000 3.7s
50000!  16.3s
It's not obviously as fast as others good algorithms but is easy to learn and can do normal math
